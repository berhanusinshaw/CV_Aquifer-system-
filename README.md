Notes on Texture Modeling in the Central Valley
Overview of the Central Valley
The Central Valley is a large structural trough filled with sediments ranging in age from Jurassic to Holocene.
Depths:
San Joaquin Valley (southern two-thirds): Up to 3 miles.
Sacramento Valley (northern one-third): Up to 6 miles.
Freshwater is mostly contained in the upper post-Eocene continental rocks and deposits with thicknesses ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 feet.
Aquifer sediments consist of heterogeneous mixtures of gravel, sand, silt, and clay.
Lithologic Data and 3-D Texture Model Development
Data derived from ~8,500 drillersâ€™ logs, with boreholes ranging from 12 to 3,000 feet below land surface.
Binary Classification:
Lithologic data classified as coarse-grained or fine-grained.
Texture (% coarse-grained sediment) calculated for 50-foot depth intervals in the drillers' logs.
A 3-D texture model was created by interpolating the percentage of coarse-grained deposits onto a 1-mile spatial grid at 50-foot depth intervals from land surface to 2,800 feet.
Key Findings from the 3-D Texture Model
General Trends:
Significant heterogeneity and systematic variation in sediment texture.
Correlations with depositional source areas, geomorphic provinces, and factors influencing alluvial fan development.
Sacramento Valley:
Predominantly fine-grained sediments, mainly volcanic-derived.
Coarser-grained deposits occur along river channels and alluvial fans from the Cascade Range and northern Sierra Nevada.
San Joaquin Valley:
Eastern Side:
Coarse-grained textures dominate, especially along major rivers.
Southern alluvial fans (derived from glaciated Sierra Nevada) are coarser-grained than northern fans.
Western Side:
Generally finer-grained, underlain by the Corcoran Clay (Tulare Formation).
Fine-grained textures due to source materials from the Coast Range (e.g., shales and marine deposits) and internally drained, low-elevation basins.
Associated with the largest subsidence areas due to groundwater withdrawals.
Implications
Understanding of texture variations aids in characterizing aquifer systems and their behavior under groundwater withdrawal.
Highlights the relationship between depositional environments and sediment texture, which is crucial for groundwater resource management and subsidence mitigation.
